# RL Agent Recommendation Uncertainty

This repository now keeps the active workflow focused on agent-agnostic
epistemic uncertainty scoring for Grid2Op recommendations.

The current flow observes any agent that exposes:

```python
agent.act(obs, reward, done)
```

It collects the agent's own rollout behavior, trains an Evidential Neural
Network (ENN) on those observation/action pairs, and adds uncertainty
percentiles to each recommendation.

The active `run_pipeline.py` orchestrates rollout collection, ENN training, and
failure-forecast training. The older implementation remains under
`archive/legacy/old_version/` for reference.

## Installation

Use Python 3.9 or 3.10. Several pinned ML dependencies, especially Grid2Op,
TensorFlow, Ray, and Torch, should not be silently upgraded.

```bash
conda create -n enn_uq python=3.10 -y
conda activate enn_uq
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Active Workflow

The pre-trained artifacts and assets are stored in the release (currently - in the pre-release).
Check [Configuration](#configuration) Section to set up the .env file.

Download the .zip archives, unpack them into the root folder and run:

```bash
python run_example.py
```

To train everything from scratch, use:
```bash
python run_pipeline.py
```

The active workflow uses:

- `.env` and `project_config.py` for shared configuration.
- `run_pipeline.py` to run the complete training pipeline.
- `training/collect_rollouts.py` to collect `(observation, action)` pairs from
  a live agent.
- `training/train_enn.py` to train and export the ENN bundle.
- `recommendation_uncertainty.py` to score recommendations.
- `run_example.py` to run an end-to-end local example.
- `app/main.py` to expose the recommendation API.

Generated rollout and ENN artifacts are written under:

```text
artifacts/<ENV_NAME>/<agent>/
|-- rollouts/
|   |-- observations.npy
|   |-- labels.npy
|   `-- actions.npy
`-- model/
    |-- enn_<agent>.pth
    |-- scaler_params.json
    |-- enn_meta.json
    `-- enn_pctile_calib.npz
```

## Supported Grid2Op Environment

The active configuration defaults to:

```text
ENV_NAME=ai4realnet_small # from https://github.com/ainetus/grid2op-scenario
```

The local Grid2Op scenario files are expected under:

```text
<ENV_LOCATION>/<ENV_NAME>
```

With the default `.env.example`, the committed local scenario is:

```text
environment/ai4realnet_small/
```

### Curriculum Agent

The active workflow expects a pre-trained CurriculumAgent package for the
`ai4realnet_small` Grid2Op environment. This package is distributed through the
project's GitHub Releases and should be placed under:

```text
assets/ai4realnet_small/
|-- model/
`-- actions/
```

The `model/` directory contains the trained agent model, and `actions/`
contains the discrete action set used by the agent. The rollout, ENN training,
example, and API scripts all expect this package to be available before they
can collect agent behavior or produce recommendations.

If the released agent artifact is not available, or if the agent needs to be
trained again for a changed environment or action space, retrain it with:

```bash
python training/train_curriculumagent.py
```

That script builds the Grid2Op environment from `.env` / `project_config.py`,
initializes `CurriculumAgent`, and runs its full Teacher -> Tutor -> Junior ->
Senior training pipeline. The trained package is saved back to:

```text
assets/<ENV_NAME>/
```

With the default configuration, this resolves to `assets/ai4realnet_small/`.


## Configuration
Create a local `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

The active scripts read configuration from environment variables first, then
`.env`, then defaults in `project_config.py`.

Main settings:

```text
ENV_NAME=ai4realnet_small
ENV_LOCATION=environment
AGENT_NAME=curriculum
ASSETS_DIR=assets
ARTIFACTS_DIR=artifacts
ROLLOUT_EPISODES=50

ENN_ROLLOUT_MAX_STEPS=0
ENN_EPOCHS=100
ENN_ANNEAL_EPOCHS=10
ENN_BATCH_SIZE=512
ENN_LR=1e-3
ENN_HIDDEN_DIM=256
ENN_DROPOUT=0.05
ENN_VAL_FRAC=0.1

FORECAST_EPISODES=50
FORECAST_MAX_STEPS=0
FORECAST_MEAN_TRIALS=20

FAILURE_EPISODES=50
FAILURE_MAX_STEPS=0
FAILURE_SAMPLING_STRIDE=20
FAILURE_THRESHOLD=0.5
EXAMPLE_N_STEPS=5

SEED=0

CURRICULUM_ITERATIONS=50
CURRICULUM_JOBS=1
CURRICULUM_TUTOR_DO_NOTHING_THRESHOLD=0.9
CURRICULUM_TUTOR_BEST_ACTION_THRESHOLD=0.999
CURRICULUM_TUTOR_MIN_UNIQUE_ROWS=100
```

The active CurriculumAgent package should be available under:

```text
assets/<ENV_NAME>/model/
assets/<ENV_NAME>/actions/
```

With the default environment name:

```text
assets/ai4realnet_small/model/
assets/ai4realnet_small/actions/
```

## Pipeline

Set the desired values in `.env`, then run:

```bash
python run_pipeline.py
```

Valid existing artifacts are reused automatically. To rerun a stage:

```bash
python run_pipeline.py --force-stage enn
python run_pipeline.py --force-stage forecast --force-stage classifier
python run_pipeline.py --force-stage all
```

Available stages are `enn-data`, `enn`, `forecast`, `failure-rows`, and
`classifier`. Use `python run_pipeline.py --help` for the remaining run options.

Run the complete pipeline with a small, isolated dataset and model:

```bash
python tests/smoke_pipeline.py
```

## ENN Training

Collect rollouts:

```bash
python training/collect_rollouts.py --agent-name curriculum --episodes 50
```

Train and export the ENN bundle:

```bash
python training/train_enn.py --agent-name curriculum
```

For a different agent, configure `AGENT_FACTORY=module:function`. The factory
receives the Grid2Op environment and must return an object exposing
`agent.act(obs, reward, done)`.

More training details are in `training/TRAINING.md`.

## API

Run locally:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Docker:

```bash
docker build -t curriculum-agent-api .
docker run --env-file .env -p 8000:8000 curriculum-agent-api
```

See [Docker Instructions](DOCKER.md) for detailed container usage, diagnostics,
and Swagger testing steps.

Endpoint:

```text
POST /api/v1/recommendation
GET  /health
```

The API returns main-project recommendation dictionaries. ENN uncertainty KPIs
are included under `kpis`:

- `uncertainty`
- `epistemic_uncertainty_total_pctile`
- `epistemic_uncertainty_action_pctile`

See `app/API.md` for the request/response contract and deployment notes.

## Tests

```bash
python tests/validate_module.py
python tests/test_api.py
```

`tests/validate_module.py` checks the uncertainty module with a synthetic ENN.
`tests/test_api.py` validates the FastAPI response shape without requiring real
Grid2Op assets.

## Legacy Workflow

The older pipeline implementation, including tutor-data ENN training, LLM rule
generation, and old model/data paths, lives in:

```text
archive/legacy/old_version/
```

Its preserved documentation is:

```text
archive/legacy/old_version/README.md
