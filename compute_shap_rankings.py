"""
compute_shap_rankings.py
========================
Per-line feature ranking from the HGB teacher, used by dual_llm.py to focus each
interpretable rule on the most relevant variables for its contingency.

For every disconnected line, features are ranked by mean(|SHAP value|) computed on the HGB
classifier over that line's samples; the top features are written to shap_rankings.json:

    { "34_35_110": ["max_line_rho", "avg_line_rho", ...], ... }

If the SHAP library is unavailable or fails on the HistGradientBoosting model, the script
falls back to scikit-learn permutation importance, which yields a very similar ranking.

Run once before dual_llm.py. No LLM calls.
